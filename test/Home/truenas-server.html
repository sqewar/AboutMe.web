  <h1 class="title3">TrueNAS</h1>
  <p class="paragraph">A local storage solution in a mirrored RAID configuration for reliability and redundancy. Have used certain apps such as wordpress for website hosting though my ISP doesnt provide us with the ability to ajust DNS routing so I couldnt get it fully working. Also used it for Immich file hosting as before this year I was on IOS and wished for a solution to my low storage and inability/time consuming procces to move files back and forth betwwen my PC and my phone.<br><br> I have currently archived the server due to using the SATA drive being requred for anouther project although if I where to set up a new server in the future I would defenetly consider buying new hardware as the board and parts I used in this project where salvaged from a laptop with a failed hard drive and degrading keyboard. The age\outdated hardware of the laptop significantly impacted performance aswell, failing to smoothly run a Mincraft server with abouve medium render distance and fewer than 5 people, though this part is on me I'm not sure why I went through with it as I knew going into it how poorly it would peform but continued anyway as wished to be able to play cross platform (Bedrock/Java) without having to pay for a third party service providers subscription.<br><br>Unfortuantly due to me uninstalling this a couple of months ago I was not able to update with pictures of the dashboard wich gave an overveiw of the standard workload. </p>
