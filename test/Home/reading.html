  <p class="paragraph">Also have an interest in fiction and non-fiction books since I was young. It started off as mostly fiction books but now enjoy reading non fiction books based on real cyber attacks/operation such as Dark wire by Joseph Cox for Non-fiction and Jack Reacher by 'lee child' series for fiction.</p>
