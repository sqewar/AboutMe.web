  <p class="paragraph2">Testing Local LLM'S with jailbreaks and more recently dirrect voice communication. Have had a real passion for Loacal AI modells since first learnt about ollama two years ago, this was before it was given a gui so the defualt method of communication was through the termanal so i configured OpenWeb UI to handle the GUI, and began downloading models and experementing with them on my own pc and later set up a portable version on a Rasberry Pi5 as its increased portability and convenience was a massive upside from running it on a desktop PC while also using it to allow for my clubs RTX compotition robot to speak and have interact with us. </p>
