  <h1 class="title3">Repairs</h1>
  <p class="paragraph">Experience jailbreaking and repairing older devices (iPhone 5s and 7 plus) aswell as experience doing teardowns and repairs on laptops. My favorite projects that I worked on out of curiosity where the screen replacement on Iphone 7PLUS including home button swap due to serial number locked components; a battery replacement aswell as later continuing with experimentation on the Iphone 5s with an external battery and removing the battery data board from the original to allow for battery health to show up which as standard doesn't have support with aftermarket parts.<br><br>In addition I have genral experiecne with computer hardware as expected, I mostly enjoy repairing or teardowns on laptops or other compact devices spesifically because I appreciate the engeneering that goes into them for the custum PCB and solutions for the limited form factor.</p>
