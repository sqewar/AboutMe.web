  <p class="paragraph">P4wnPi aloa description: P4wn pi is compatible with the raspberry pi zero/zero w, Once booted the pi creates a host network for the actor to connect to, this network provides access to the web terminal where payloads, emulation and  settings and  can be configured written and run. The small form factor provides it an advantage over other simular tools due to its inconspicutiaty as shown with it inside a cuflink case below.  What truely sets this apart from standard BUSB's though is that if the user somehow manages to plug this device into your computer it can be devestating as payloads can be writen, loaded and triggered remotly by a mobile phone or similar device what setts it appart from a standard bad USB is it capabilitys to emulate more than one device such as one minute it can pretend to be an ethernet cable (ethernet over USB) and the next second it can be a mouse, keyboard or USB thumb drive.<br><br> In practice I have fair experience working with the raspberry pi and writing USB scripts through p4wn pi allowa and for flipper Zero, though have never used on anyone elses machine, making it more of a intrest and curiosity driven project.</p>
