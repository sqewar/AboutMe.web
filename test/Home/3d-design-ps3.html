  <h1 class="title">3D Design</h1>
  <p class="paragraph">Experience in digital design and 3d modelling and printing though would like to get a 3d printer of my own to be able to develop design iterations for case remodels of the ps3 for better cooling to solve the known issue extremely present in the 70nm chips where ylod (yellow light of death) would be caused due to the connections between a chip and the motherboard to get micro fractures due to the expansion and contraction on the board and chip happening at different rates.</p>
