 • Originally had more of an interest in computer hardware and infrastructure but they have slightly shifted over the past couple of years from begining to watch YouTubers such as NetworkChuck in 2022-23 and now am very much invested in cyber security and would say I have a fairly developed understanding of basic terminology such as attack types (deauth, dos/ddos, evil twin, etc) and viruses (RAT or trogen, slave (for botnet), keylogger, adware etc).<br>
