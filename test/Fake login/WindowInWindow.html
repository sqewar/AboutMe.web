  <p class="paragraph">Example of fake login window within webpage:<br><br>Description:The links below will take to to the corrosponding version of the clalculator, bear in mind that the mobile version was developed on a Motorola Thinkphone 25 which has a unique aspect ratio and havnt yet reconfigured it to work on percentages instead so it may look off on some devices.<br><br>The goal of the following project was to make an intuitive calculator app taylored to touch screen devices. As mentioned abouve it is not yet supported by traditional ratios, it was developed on 20:9 and have tested on select touch screen devices such as tablets and ipads and have had vareing degrees of success at this time, however reworking the positioning into percentages is defenetly somthing I am looking to do to allow cross platform and resizing support.<br><br>My proposed target market for this product would be primary school aged children due to its orientation and button positions intentionally mirrowing that of mobile games such as roblox, I hope this will have a posotive effect on the speed wich they take to catch onto using a calculator and in theory due to the natural horizontal grip of a mobile device it should allow for the use of both thumbs leading to a faster input speed than on a traditional claculator.</p>
